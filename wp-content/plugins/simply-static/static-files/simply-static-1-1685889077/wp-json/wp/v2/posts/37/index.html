Found child care. Asked her brother for a ride. And set off early one morning to drive north across state lines to 22,000-person Carbondale.<\/p>\n<p>It was a nearly seven-hour round trip from her home in Tennessee. Long enough for the decision to rattle in her head as the flat Midwestern landscape slipped by the car windows.<\/p>\n<p>No, she told herself. I thought it out. It&#8217;s not the right moment to have a child.<\/p>\n<p>She was already raising two young children. She had split with her boyfriend. She was financially unstable from losing a job. And she could face health risks.<\/p>\n<p>She finally tried to go to sleep.<\/p>\n<p>They crossed into Illinois.<\/p>\n<p>From there it was another hour\u2019s drive to the outskirts of Carbondale, a place often reached by a two-lane state highway that winds by farm fields and churches or a busier route dotted with fast food, strip malls and a building on which, for a time, hung a banner reading, \u201cPro Life. Pro God. Pro Gun. Pro Trump.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mostly rural, conservative southern Illinois was an unexpected place for an abortion clinic, the 26-year-old thought, even if the town\u2019s welcome sign noted it was home to Southern Illinois University.<\/p>\n<p>They parked outside a single-story office building, across from a Kroger, at the Choices Center for Reproductive Health. She walked in past a security guard to a waiting room, donning a green wristband.<\/p>\n<p>When it became clear Roe v. Wade would be overturned, Choices Center for Reproductive Health looked to move abortion services from Memphis to Carbondale, Illinois, where abortion would remain legal. Choices braced for expected anti-abortion demonstrations and hired a security guard.<br \/>\nTOP AND ABOVE LEFT: NICOLE HESTER, THE TENNESSEAN\/USA TODAY NETWORK; ABOVE RIGHT: CHRIS KENNING, USA TODAY<br \/>\nSoon she sat on an exam table.<\/p>\n<p>Outside, a staffer put a mark on a whiteboard grid where the center kept track of its days, a row for each of six rooms, a column for each of the four people a patient would wait to see, including a nurse and a medical provider. Once each row was checked off, one patient was done; the next one could begin. Nearby, receptionists scheduled appointments for patients from as far away as Texas and Mississippi.<\/p>\n<p>After medical checks and an explanation of what to expect, the woman with the green wristband lifted a small water bottle and swallowed the first of two pills that would end her pregnancy.<\/p>\n<p>Similar scenes play out each day five miles away, a short drive past the city\u2019s Amtrak station, downtown shops and neon-lit 1950s-era Dairy Queen, on the other side of town. There, at an anodyne medical office where a vinyl sign stuck in the grass reads \u201cAlamo Women\u2019s Clinic,\u201d the parking lot is often filled with out-of-state license plates \u2013 women who drive as long as 10 hours from the Deep South for an abortion.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CARBONDALE, Ill. \u2013 The 26-year-old had never heard of the distant southern Illinois town, but it had become the closest option.
