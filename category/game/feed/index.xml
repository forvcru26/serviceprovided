										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legacy are two fairly different games. While Elden Ring is a melee-focused, brutally difficult journey through a wonderfully dark and oppressive fantasy world, Hogwarts Legacy is a bit more of a whimsical, lighthearted, and magical adventure through one of the most nostalgic locations in all of popular culture, with spell-based combat and calm exploration being the focus of its own gameplay.</p>
<p>That being said, Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legacy aren&#8217;t totally opposed to one another. Both games use a third-person perspective, both put an emphasis on open-world exploration, and most interestingly, both have their fair share of magic spells. But when it comes to Elden Ring and Hogwarts Legacy&#8217;s magic, both games could find themselves in the same boat pretty soon.</p>
<p>In the past, FromSoftware games have had some notoriously lackluster magic combat options. While there were always plenty of spells in the Dark Souls trilogy, the vast majority of the offensive spell types felt simply too weak in practice, leaving them pretty redundant when compared to the game&#8217;s melee options. With Elden Ring, FromSoftware sought to finally change this, and for the most part, it succeeded.</p>
<p>At launch, Elden Ring boasted an eye-watering total of 171 magical spells, covering both Incantations and Sorceries. For reference, Skyrim has 96 spells. What&#8217;s even more impressive than the sheer quantity of Elden Ring&#8217;s spells is the quality of them. While not all of them are wholly original, and many are upgraded versions of base spells that essentially just add another projectile to the cast, almost every spell in Elden Ring is worth picking for one reason or another, and each one has its own visually-impressive, unique animation and effect.</p>
<p>But Elden Ring is set to receive a large-scale expansion soon, and it could run into a big issue with its magic. Titled Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree, this DLC expansion is set to be the biggest DLC that FromSoftware has ever produced, which is really saying something. So, naturally, fans can probably expect to see a slew of new spells in the game. But with 171 spells already available, Elden Ring&#8217;s DLC might not be able to really add anything that fans haven&#8217;t already seen.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy could end up being in a similar boat. Though Hogwarts Legacy has much fewer spells than Elden Ring, clocking in at only 31, a lot of effort has seemingly gone into making each one feel truly distinct and worthwhile, with unique visuals, animations, and effects across the board for each one. Hogwarts Legacy&#8217;s current spells really cover just about everything that players could need or want from a Harry Potter game, with offensive spells like Stupefy and Flipendo, utility charms like Lumos and Reparo, and even all three Unforgivable Curses.</p>
<p>If Hogwarts Legacy ever receives its long-rumored DLC, it&#8217;ll surely add a good few new spells to the game, just like Elden Ring&#8217;s Shadow of the Erdtree, but really there isn&#8217;t a big need for them. Though many fans are desperate to see iconic spells like Expecto Patronum, Reducto, and Confundo come to Hogwarts Legacy, they might end up feeling a little redundant, with Hogwarts Legacy&#8217;s current spell list covering pretty much all the bases from a purely technical and gameplay standpoint. So, much like Elden Ring, Hogwarts Legacy would have a tough time making any additional DLC spells stand out from the crowd.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Within the grand scheme of Zelda&#8217;s many timelines, it seems that The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom might be the closing chapter to The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword and serves as a bookend to the game where the cycle first began. Before its release, many had speculated about the possible connections The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom might have with other games from across the series, with most theories focusing on Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess. But Tears of the Kingdom&#8217;s story and its position within Zelda&#8217;s timelines could suggest that the cycle may finally be broken.</p>
<p>By examining various details from across Tears of the Kingdom, such as its story, its themes, and its imagery, it&#8217;s possible to piece together how exactly Nintendo&#8217;s latest Zelda game connects all the way back to Skyward Sword. Though not the first ever published Zelda game, it caused controversy for canonizing the most essential Zelda lore despite eventually being considered the series&#8217; worst game to date. But Tears of the Kingdom might have redeemed Skyward Sword by creating a narrative and gameplay experience that endeavors to resolve its predecessor&#8217;s mistakes, ultimately providing closure to both it and Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>From the start of Tears of the Kingdom&#8217;s story, the game introduces and explains the mythos of the Zonai. Though they were included in passing references in Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom expands on this new lore by suggesting that long before Hyrule had even formed that the Zonai had come down from the heavens. While they didn&#8217;t believe they were gods, Rauru acknowledges that the technology of Constructs, Zonai devices, and Secret Stones would have given that impression. Despite this, Rauru still established himself as king and took a Hylian wife, and this is claimed to be the origin of Hyrule&#8217;s founding.</p>
<p>However, this conflicts with the canon that Skyward Sword establishes, as its story suggests that Zelda and Link remain on the surface and form the first kingdom of Hyrule. But while there are some details that might contradict one another, it is possible to join the two narratives together. For instance, both games make reference to how sky islands serve to protect others from evil, how advanced beings came down from the sky, and how the lines blur between the supernatural and technological. With a small adjustment, it&#8217;s arguable that Tears of the Kingdom is continuing from Skyward Sword&#8217;s canon.</p>
<p>What serves as a linchpin to this theory though is Fi. Though she has been regarded by fans as the worst companion in Zelda, Fi has seen recent defense as a great concept just badly executed. Despite claiming to be a spirit created by the Goddess Hylia, Fi is without question presented as if she were an artificial intelligence, which could mean she actually has Zonai origins with her history being rewritten. This theory is strengthened in Tears of the Kingdom by its story focusing on restoring the Master Sword, Fi&#8217;s theme from Skyward Sword playing during cutscenes, and the sword &#8220;responding&#8221; to other characters.</p>
<p>In its prologue, Skyward Sword explains how the likes of Skyloft and other islands came into existence, stating that fissures opened up on the surface and let loose evil forces. This is uncannily similar to Tears of the Kingdom and the event that it dubs the &#8220;Upheaval,&#8221; which chasms opening up across Hyrule that Gloom emanates from. Throughout Zelda, many games have references to an &#8220;Underworld&#8221; which was claimed to be where Ganondorf and his minions resided. This too is also reflected in Tears of the Kingdom, with Ganondorf&#8217;s armies populating the Depths and where Ganondorf himself has made his lair beneath Hyrule Castle.</p>
<p>Similarly, as the forebear to Ganondorf, Demise is also described to be the Demon King who commands an army from beneath the earth. But more specifically, during Skyward Sword&#8217;s story, it is revealed that Demise is attempting to break free from a seal he was placed under long ago, with the player encountering a boss named &#8220;The Imprisoned&#8221; on multiple occasions. Tears of the Kingdom again appears to directly parallel this narrative, with Ganondorf attempting to break free of a seal placed on him during &#8220;The Imprisoning War.&#8221; While Ganondorf is the reincarnation of Demise, the connections seem too close to just be self-referential.</p>
<p>Much like Fi, there is evidence that supports the theory that Tears of the Kingdom&#8217;s and Skyward Sword&#8217;s parallels are more than they seem, and it can be seen with Ganondorf after he has one of the Secret Stones. Not only do these Secret Stones bear a resemblance to Skyward Sword&#8217;s Sacred Tears which further ties into Tears of the Kingdom&#8217;s subtitle, but Ganondorf&#8217;s transformation further evokes the same look of Demise once he has been resurrected. Between flowing fiery tendrils of hair and his body pulsing with Malice or Gloom, Tears of the Kingdom presents its version of Ganondorf as Demise in everything but name.</p>
<p>Between Skyward Sword, Tears of the Kingdom, and Beyond</p>
<p>Though the Zelda series isn&#8217;t likely to end with Tears of the Kingdom as its ultimate finale, especially since a new Zelda game is supposedly already being planned, it&#8217;s possible that just as Skyward Sword began the timeline, Tears of the Kingdom appears to end it. Breath of the Wild had already been confirmed by Nintendo as the supposed inevitable endpoint of Zelda&#8217;s three branching timelines, and as its sequel so too does Tears of the Kingdom. It would therefore make sense in Zelda&#8217;s larger narrative to have the closure of these branching timelines directly engage with the legacy Skyward Sword had first set out.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the series could still live on with Zelda games set between the two endpoints of Skyward Sword and Tears of the Kingdom as the latter emphasizes the millennia of history Hyrule has. But this could be Nintendo&#8217;s plan to redress the errors from Skyward Sword, from small details like perfecting the use of stamina to the large such as perfecting a world within the sky, and ultimately perform a soft reboot. Until now, speculation around Zelda&#8217;s timelines has overshadowed each game&#8217;s release, so Tears of the Kingdom could start a new Zelda timeline altogether.</p>
